### Emergency Department Low Urgency Care


#### Purpose
The interactive dashboard allows the user to explore:

* the geographic distribution of low urgency care delivered in emergency departments throughout Australia, and the
*	correlation of this activity with the prevalence of specific chronic medical conditions, and
* correlation with the overall burden of disease, as reflected by the prevalence of multiple chronic medical conditions.

#### Definitions
*Low urgency* Emergency Department (ED) presentations are defined by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) as:

* a person seeking unplanned care at an ED, and
* initially assessed (triage) as *semi-urgent* (ATS 4) or *non-urgent* (ATS 5)^1^ , having
* not arrived by ambulance, police or correctional services, and
* was not admitted to the hospital (ward), transferred to another hospital, and
* did not die in the Emergency Department^2^

*In-hours* is defined as weekdays 8am to 8pm and Saturdays 8am to 1pm (excluding public holidays) and represent typical availability of General Practice primary care.  *After-hours* is the complement of this.


#### Why?
Understanding low urgency ED presentations can improve the allocation of healthcare resources.  Low urgency ED presentations may be used as a proxy measure of access to primary health care. A significant proportion of these patients may be managed via more efficient and effective models of care.

#### Data and Geography
Data from both AIHW and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2012 Census is utilised:

*	AIHW: Use of emergency departments for lower urgency care: 2021-22^3^, and
*	ABS 2021 Census: General Community Profile for Statistical Area 3 (SA3)^4^.
Both sources provide data according to Statistical Areas Level 3 (SA3s) â€“ 340 geographic areas covering Australia, defined by the ABS.  This is the resolution of the geographic analysis, as well as the basis on which the data was merged.
